## Getting started ambient-app--react front-end

### Install dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js (>= 18) and npm or yarn installed.

```
npm install
```


### Run the development server

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000

### Project structure


* `components/` - reusable React components. 
* `containers/` - screens and other components that are not intended for reuse
* `utils/` - helpers
* `consts/` - constants
* `assets/` - images and other assets imported in React code

### Code formatting

* Use uppercase names for React Components files and related CSS files
* Use BEM naming convention for CSS classes - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/understanding-the-css-bem-convention/
* Use ESLint (ToDo: add ESLint to project)
